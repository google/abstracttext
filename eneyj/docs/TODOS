Should it be evaluate or should it be quote / unquote?

> keys(value(head(tail(by_key(name, "Z8K4")))))
[Z1K1, Z14K1]

typekeys Z599 does not work properly
[head([first, second]), head(tail([first, second]))]
it works with write_eval and value. Can that be moved into show?

(blocked on newal)
(happens because there is no evaluation for Z7/Z16/Z19 inside of a Z14)

for feature parity:

* show Z200

- remove .label and .id

- think if the escaping is now any good or just nonsense
 - make an util for escape string and one for unescape string
 - make escaping character something else than /? maybe ^
 - maybe delete unescapeString, seems reimplemented in parse


set linearizer in CLI
- .l Z105 -> all is undefined
- allow for spaces
- allow for names instead of ZIDs
- display using a parse
- validate the result
- clean up answer.js lin code
- set language interact with linearize?
- remove the boolean linearizer option
- remove jsondir, typedlin, color, etc options

read
- read takes the output of write and turns it into z objects

- internalize construct
- internalize parse as read
- internalize validate
- rethink evaluate
  - write(Z110) - write(lambda_ten) - first evals lambda_ten and then writes it
  - reconsider
  - some of the functions in the 60s areas look wrong, should be IDs not functions
  - use Z584 instead of Z583 when the new evaluation works

[and, or]
[and, or, negate]
[and, and]
[and, multiply] (6s)
[add, or] (6s)

(this might be solved by newal)

map(curry_right(show, English), list_character_abc)

should be solved by newal (or rather, stronger type checking)

- .forget to forget all data in cli

- awards

- keys not as strings but as entities

- abstract from language

- abstract language types
  - type for abstract feature dimension
  - type for abstract features
  - type for abstract_tabletype = meaningtype
  - abstract words = meanings = constructor

map(filter(everything, curry_left(is_of_type, error_message)), curry_left(Z185, Z251))
crashes the runtime (the error is in the curry_left(Z185, Z251) at the end,
it should be curry_right)

try Z540 with Croatian, errors are not handled well

In Z297 I used Z299K1 should be figured out by validator?

Z180K2(English) = by_key(English, "Z180K2")

[true, false, true, false, false, false, false, true, true, false, true, true, false, true, true, false, false, true, false, false, true, true, true, true, true, false, false, false, false]

- utils.endOfList, utils.writeList, builtin.Z24 has too many exceptions

- shouldn't there be only two results?

> everything_by_type(kleenean)
[maybe, kleenean_true, kleenean_false, kleenean_false]

- shouldn't there be only three results?

- make implementations stand alone
- make tests stand alone

- make tests have a predicate for checking the result, not a value
- make tests be able to have functioncalls instead of values for args

- make result type of functions be flexible, but not argument types

- need to check table types, really

- allow "constructor" as a label

- access implementations
- choose implementations
- run a test

- i18n the good bye message from the cli

- validation could be split into two different types of validation:
  - static validation
  - dynamic validation
  - the difference is probably only relevant for Z7
  - maybe also Z8 if you take all tests into account
  - basically, whenever you run a Z7 it does all the tests while running the Z7
  - on every result, it compares the types, etc.
  - dynamic and static validation should be made available as functions
  - so you can run it from the command line

- is that possible, though? will dynamic_validation(not(true)) run
  dynamic_validation(false) or dynamic_validation(not(true))?
- is that a CLI problem?
- how does a function like evaluation interact with CLI?

- figure out dispatching

== Exceptions and errors ==

exceptions on raising and on accepting
- if does not accept an exception, then just pass them up

- exceptions should probably be explicitly allowed when handled
- but anything must be allowed to raise or pass an exception
- can we move more and more of the errors to exceptions?

The following problem requires better exception handling.
Then this would not be an issue.
Suggestion: exceptions that the function is interested in have to be declared.
All others are just passed up.

For new exception handling:

Z1 parameters:
- Z26 write
- Z31 if
- Z32 type of
- Z33 same
- Z36 value
- Z37 reify
- Z63 show
- Z68 reduce
- Z78 curry left
- Z79 curry right
- Z105 id
- Z149 type as string
- Z163 if_lambda
- Z185 name from Z object
- Z190 by key
- Z199 has key
- Z329 curry chain left
- Z335 return five
- Z368 is first
- Z369 is first predicate
- Z370 is exception
- Z371 try else
- Z393 is of type
- Z510 keys

Z1 results:
- Z31 if
- Z34 first
- Z35 second
- Z36 value
- Z38 abstract
- Z64 head
- Z68 reduce
- Z105 id
- Z106 find_second_by_first

try in the validation phase, evaluation doesn't have the types anymore.
Worked, but only for positional :P

Problems: Z185
(maybe Z157, Z158, Z190)

==

- everything is slow because Z10s are now evaluated,
  which means they are constantly linearized, because
  linearization is needed for memoizing
- need fast keying for memoization
- or need a different Z10 for constructing and carrying around
- as we did with cons Z63 and pair Z10
- maybe we can freeze just before memoization and add a hash to each value
- (but how would we know the hash before calculating it?)

functions that return tables:
map(filter(filter(everything, curry_left(is_of_type, function)), curry_chain_left(same, curry_right(by_key, "Z8K2"), table)), curry_right(Z185, Z251))
all tabletypes:
filter(everything, curry_left(is_of_type, tabletype))
functions with 3 parameters:
map(filter(filter(everything, curry_left(is_of_type, function)), Z329(same, number_of_parameter, positive_integer("3"))), curry_right(Z185, Z251))


The following function
map(filter(filter(everything, curry_left(is_of_type, function)), curry_chain_left(same, curry_right(by_key, "Z8K2"), boolean)), curry_right(Z185, Z251))
contains and [object Object] in its result, which is not good

- internalize everything as far as possible

- first set of grammar
  x det_en_definite_plural
  x det_en_indefinite_plural
  x vp_from_np_en
  x vp_en as tabletype
  x cl_from_np_vp_en
  - np_from_person (seems to work?)
  x s_from_cl

functions to write
- curry(function, positive_integer, value)
- type_of_parameter(positive_integer, function)

- the copout breaks in validation of Z7 break too much
  - this is why the following passes although it should be a type mismatch:
  lambda_if(boolean_to_lambda(true), true, false)

- make parameter label optional when the type is sufficiently speaking
  - but check on linearization whether it doubles

- see if Z203 should be rewritten in the style of Z204

- rewrite Z205 as a map over the possible values of case

- make the different tabletypes types
  - with selectible and inherent dimensions

- make the different language features types
  - much more readable set_table_option

- set_table_option with higher arity?

- pushtowiki and see if anything works

- turn as many errors into exceptions as possible

- i18n
  - cli
  - test
  - scripts in scripts

- to normalize or remove:
  - Z4K1
  - Z11K2
  - Z16K1
  - Z16K2
  - Z18K1
  - Z60K1
  - Z70K1
  - Z180K2

- completer can be much smarter
  - use expected and return types
  - complete with a comma or a closing bracket
  - complete with an opening string? closing string?
  - offer argument name when writing arguments, in dark
    power(|base, exponent) (with the part after the cursor being dark)
  - complete in middle of text, not only end (if possible?)
  - extra: complete is_maybe(|(true)) with functions from boolean_to_kleenean
  - better search including aliases for Z expressions

- use commands to generate the cli arguments

- algebraic types

- figure out equality - builtin Z33 is weird
  - fix the problem that leads to linearize/Z180
  - basically, same(en, en) did not work because same strips of Z1K2 before
    comparing
  - could be solved by making same smarter, i.e. have some same that includes id
  - and some same that doesn't
  - and introduce same_language I guess for languages?
  - the identity of a language should be the QID?

- Z357 is the same as Z356, should be like Z300
  - but no ID leads to caching issues
  - figure out how to do that
  - same with Z358 and Z300
  - remove the Z357, Z358 and Z300 from test then
  - Z300 has no label (used to be project_name_characterlist)

- create a translator before evaluation?
- so that Z40 lambda function could be simpler
  - but translates to a real Z8 for evaluation
- the same could be for Z9, which could be just a function call to Z7

- all implementations should be in their own Zobjects

- lambda functions have no return type and no type for the params

- run tests in Z8s during the test script?

- move some functions from Z8 to Z40

- there should be a shortcut using argumentreferences
  ...: E24A4 -> ...: { Z1K1: Z18, Z18K1: E24A1 }

- get rid of Z7?

- we want to have types such as
  - Z10(Z6) - list of strings
  - Z2(Z6, E32) - a pair of a string and integer
  - this wouldn't be literally Z10(Z6)
  - it would be a call to a function that produces such parametrized types
  - then there would be functions that can be called on such parametrized types
  - these functions would be the results of a functioncall themselves
  - example:
    - Z10(Z6) list of strings
    - there would be a function E25 - constructor for Z10(Z6)
    - E25 takes Z6 - string as an argument
    - want to call E26 - length on an instance of Z10(Z6):
      E26: Z10(Z6) -> positive_integer
    - want to call E27 - head on it
      E27: Z10(Z6) -> Z6 (ideally)
    - want to call E28 - append on it
      E28: Z10(Z6), Z6 -> Z10(Z6)
      E28: Z10(Z6), Z11 -> error
    - maybe:
      there would be a generic version of append
      the generic version of append has the interface (Z10(Z1), Z1)
      there is a function that produces a specific version of append
      the specific version of append has the interface (Z10(Z6), Z6)
      now, can I use the generic version of append on the specific value?

- move implementations to their own entities
- add argument IDs

- add eneyj version to calibration/system.json

- internalize validation for validating objects
  - check that all keys are defined
  - run validators in type
  - run validators in keys
  - validate that keys and values fit
  - run the validators on the values

- make exceptions Z Objects

- AbstractTextContent
  - the labelized version should be based on the data, not on disc by name

- create an expander for eneyj objects that
  - turns arrays into lists
  - turns values into references
  - turns values into function calls

- add documentation on cl.js and all scripts

- maybe calls to listify should be calls to expand?

- create a canonicalizer for eneyj objects that
  - turns lists into arrays
  - turns references into values
  - turns function calls into values

- create a tool that turns names to identifiers

- once it is all IDs, sort keys in formatter

- one check is in general of eneyj objects, one is for the specific types
  - so for example, aliases, canonical_name etc. are tested for all objects
  - but the specific things of types are checked only for the given types

- a validator takes an object and returns a list of issues
  - an issue is a type, with a code and a message?
  - difference from exception or error?

- display in wiki

- linearize in abstract but also in canonical_name

- tools to keep M: namespace and local data directory in sync

- connect to wiki
  - set language

node src/cl.js 'np_from_det_noun_en(det_en_one, person_en_marie_curie)'

- add preconditions
  - per function
  - per implementation
- add postconditions
  - per function
  - per implementation
  - static postcondition (always true) vs dynamic pc (depends on value)
- add invariants
  - per function
  - per implementation

- turn number, plural into symbol (so that plural knows it belongs to number)
  - set_table_option(table, plural) instead of sto(table, number, plural)
  - plural(table) as shortcut for set_table_option(table, plural)
  - goal is to be able to state:
  - number_en(np_en_a_rose) / np_en_a_rose(number_en) -> singuar_en
  - noun_en_rose(singular_en)/singular_en(noun_en_rose) -> noun_en_rose_singlr

- simplify functions on table (np from det noun)

- node src/cl.js 'string_from_table(set_table_option(noun_en_encyclopedia, string("number"), string("singulars")))' -> key-not-found, should be set-table-failed
(because string_from_table on exception actually tries to work)

- select_text_by_language_with_default

- add exception handling to running type:code lang:js

- move some of the tests from tests.js to test in implementation

- add native implementations:
  ✓ character_to_string
  - concatenate
  - cons
  - first
  - head
  - make_pair
  - second
  - tail
  ✓ type_of

- replace internal if with lambda if
  - have a field on true and false pointing to lambda_true and lambda_false
  - replace mapping from true to lambda_true by that field instead of iffing

- proper security model for type:code
- catch exceptions and time outs when running code

- generic handling of values if there is no such native handling

- proper equality

- should predecessor(0) be 0 or an exception?

- what about type:code that doesn't parse or execute?

- rename lambda functions to lambda?

- add timer to cl.js

- be able to get version (both for cl and as an internal function)

- internalize natify and denatify in the languages

- for code, check that the type conversion exists at validation time

- validate results from abstract
- validate results from code
- validate all results?

- clean up if_boolean
- clean up if_kleenean
- check need for _if_boolean_switch
- function get_return_type, so that "if" can be rewritten
- have two forms of "if", if and if_explicit

- parser
  - parse quotes
  - parse escapes
- pair
  - but have a typed pair, but how?

- characterlist = list(character)
- list(T) = pair(T, either(pair(T), nil)

- internalize the validation and schema for types like boolean, integer, etc.
  - add this to boolean:
  "possible_values":
    [{"type": "reference","reference": "true"},
     {"type": "reference","reference": "false"}],
  "allows_other_fields": {"type": "reference","reference": "false"}

- if running chatty calibration, show also diffs

- negative numbers

- kleenean_or

- serialize multiple implementations as -> [a, b] instead of -> a -> b

- add unicode test to string that is far away in unicode
  - 👩🏿‍🔬 __character_scientist
  - _string_unicode

- for type safety of functions, introduce signatures on function type
  - can be local only? probably not
  - I first would say 'signature = string "bool -> bool -> bool"'
  - but doesn't feel right. maybe list(type) instead? but requires lists
  - seems to require both lists and non-enum types

- move type checking to the actual types. i.e. any knows what it accepts,
  function knows what it accepts, etc.
  - i.e. instead of type must be equivalent, call the type to check
- think about object type (maybe should be any or top?)

- check that types of test data conforms the type declarations in functions

Types
  - complex, like list and either
  - function is complex
  - error
  - nothing or null
  - strings
  - integers
  - structs (objects)
  - tables (selectors and properties, e.g. noun>string: needs case, has gender)

- consider typing for id

- fallbacks everywhere
- optionals
- defaults
- pattern matching
- closures - do they work correctly?

- return_value_type in if (more than one place) in alpha and beta not converted

- understand typing for linearizing lambda
  - boolify, intify, stringify, etc., i.e turn λxλy.x into 'true' etc.
  - use de bruijn indexing? for canonicalization?
  - use de bruijn indexing for same
- understand typing for validating lambda

- add checks to all of the stuffs that exist
  - validate - it seems that higher order validation needs lists? see below
    - function
      - check if argument names in implementations are defined and welltyped
    - function call
      - constructor calls
  - internal
    - if

- coercion
- rewrite if

- put the eval into one big try loop? how to deal with errors in eval?

- random value test runner

- make a walker?

- think about zero-argument functions

- tease validation and evaluation apart

- check all files in data are used in test
- change to a proper test framework

- problem: if in a language we don't have a word for 'ice' but use
  'frozen water' instead, how do we avoid making sentences such as
  'Frozen water is frozen water.'
